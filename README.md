EC 441 – Computer Networking Portfolio

This repository contains my weekly work for EC 441: Introduction to Computer Networking (Spring 2026). 
Each submission reflects engagement with networking concepts across all layers of the network stack through problems, labs, reports, and experiments.

Generative AI Usage:
Generative AI tools are used to support idea development, provide examples, clarify technical concepts, and refine explanations. 
The goal is active engagement with the material, not simply generating answers.

Tools and Models:
  -Platform: ChatGPT
  -Model(s): GPT-5 series

How AI Is Used:
  -Generating example problems and lab ideas
  -Providing worked examples to test understanding
  -Verifying calculations (e.g., subnetting, CRC, throughput)
  -Explaining networking concepts in multiple ways
  -Improving the structure and clarity of written reports

All final submissions reflect my understanding of the material. AI is used as a learning assistant to deepen comprehension and support experimentation.
